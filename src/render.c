//  DDA starts. It's a loop that increments
// the ray with 1 square every time,
// until a wall is hit.
// Each time,
// either it jumps a square in the x-direction
//(with stepX) or a square in the y-direction (with stepY),
// it always jumps 1 square at once. If the
// ray's direction would be the x-direction,
// the loop will only have to jump a
// square in the x-direction everytime,
// because the ray will never change its y-direction.
// If the ray is a bit sloped to the y-direction,
// then every so many jumps in the x-direction, the ray will
// have to jump one square in the
// y-direction. If the ray is exactly the y-direction,
// it never has to jump in the x-direction, etc...
// sideDistX and sideDistY get incremented
// with deltaDistX with every jump in their direction,
// and mapX and mapY get incremented with stepX and stepY respectively.
//   When the ray has hit a wall, the loop ends, and then
// we'll know whether an x-side or y-side of a wall was
// hit in the variable "side",
// and what wall
// was hit with mapX and mapY. We won't know exactly where
// the wall was hit however,
// but that's
// not needed in this case because we won't use textured walls for now.
